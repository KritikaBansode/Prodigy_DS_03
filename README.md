# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

# Overview
This project made under Prodigy InfoTech. It involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model is trained using the Bank Marketing dataset. The decision tree classifier is a powerful tool for classification tasks and provides clear, interpretable decision rules.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing dataset, which contains information about clients of a Portuguese bank. The dataset includes features such as age, job, marital status, and previous contact details, and the target variable indicates whether a client subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no).

# Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

# Results
The decision tree classifier provides an intuitive way to understand how different features contribute to the prediction. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall.
