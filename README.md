# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

# Overview
This project made under Prodigy InfoTech. It involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model is trained using the Bank Marketing dataset. The decision tree classifier is a powerful tool for classification tasks and provides clear, interpretable decision rules.

The dataset includes features such as age, job, marital status, and previous contact details, and the target variable indicates whether a client subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no).
